__1.__ The data set FOREST.XLS contains data on $Y =$ deforestation, $X =$ population density, $W =$ change in cropland, and $Z =$ change in pasture land.

* __(a)__ Run a regression of $Y$ on $X$ and interpret the results.

* __(b)__ Run a regression of $Y$ on $W$ and on of $Y$ on $Z$ and interpret the results.

* __(c)__ Create a new variable, $V$, by dividing $X$ by 100. What are the units in terms of which $V$ is measured?

* __(d)__ Run a regression of $Y$ on $V$. Compare your results to those for (a). How do you interpret your coefficient estimate of $\beta$? How does
          $\hat{\alpha}$ differ between (a) and (d)?

* __(e)__ Experiment with scaling dependent and explanatory variables (i.e. by dividing them by a constant) and see what effect this has on your coefficient estimates. 
          Summarize your findings.


<br>


__2.__ Using the FOREST.XLS data set run regressions for $Y$ on each of $X$, $W$, and $Z$ as defined in (1) above. 

* __(a)__ Produce line fit plots for each regression. Interpret the results for each.

* __(b)__ Produce residual plots for each regression. Interpret the results for each.


<br>


__3.__ Using the FOREST.XLS data set, run a regression of $Y$ on $X$. 

* __(a)__ What is the $R^{2}$?

* __(b)__ Calculate the correlation between $Y$ and $X$?

* __(c)__ Discuss the relationship between your answers to (a) and (b).

* __(d)__ Redo (a) for the regressions of $Y$ on the variables $W$ and $Z$. Comment on the fit of each regression.


<br>


__4.__ Using the data set FOREST.XLS examine different $XY$-plots involving the variables $X$, $Y$, $W$, and $Z$. Does there seem to be a nonlinear relationship
       between any pair of variables?


<br>


__5.__ Repeat exercise (4) with the data set in ADVERT.XLS.


<br>


__6.__ Data set EX46.XLS contains two variables, labeled $Y$ and $X$.

__(a)__ Make an $XY$-plot of these two variables. Does the relationship between $Y$ and $X$ appear to be linear? 

__(b)__ Calculate the square root of $X$. 

__(c)__ Make an $XY$-plot of the square root of $X$ against $Y$. Does this relationship appear to be linear? 

__(d)__ Run regressions of $Y$ on $X$ and $Y$ on the square root of $X$. Compare the results.



<br>


__7.__ Use the data set in ELECTRIC.XLS where $Y =$ cost of production and $X =$ output.

* __(a)__ Run a regression of $Y$ on $X$.

* __(b)__ Take log transformations of both variables. 

* __(c)__ Run a regression of $ln(Y)$ on $ln(X)$ and interpret your results.
