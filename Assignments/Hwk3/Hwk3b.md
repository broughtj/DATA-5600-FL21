__1.__ The data sets used to calculate Figures 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 in the Koop textbook (_Analysis of Economic Data_) are in FIG51.XLS,
       FIG52.XLS, FIG53.XLS, and FIG54.XLS.

* __(a)__ Calculate the OLS estimates of $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$ for these four data sets. How close are they to 0 and 1
        (the values used to simulate the data)?

* __(b)__ Calculate $95\%$ confidence intervals for $\alpha$ for the four data sets. Examine how the width of the confidence interval relates to $N$
        and the variability of the errors.

* __(c)__ Calculate $99\%$ and $90\%$ confidence intervals for the data sets. How do these differ from the results in (b)?


<br>


__2.__ The file ADVERT.XLS contains data on annual sales($Y$) and advertising expenditure ($X$) (both measured in millions of dollars) for
       84 companies in the US.

* __(a)__ Run a regression of $Y$ on $X$ and obtain $95\%$ confidence intervals for $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

* __(b)__ Write a careful explanation of what the $95\%$ confidence interval for $\beta$ means in terms of the possible range of values that the
        effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable may take. 


<br>


__3.__ The data set ELECTRIC.XLS has data on the costs of production ($Y$, measured in millions of dollars) and output ($X$, measured in
       thousands of kilowat hours) for 123 electricity utility companies in the US. Repeat exercise (2) for this data set.


<br>


__4.__ Using the data set FOREST.XLS run a regression of $Y$ (deforestation) on $X$ (population density). Test the hypothesis that
       $\alpha = 0$. 


<br>


__5.__ Also using the FOREST.XLS data set. 

* __(a)__ Run a regression of $Y$ (deforestation) on $W$ (percentage change in cropland) and interpret the results. Conduct a hypothesis
        test to see if the expansion of cropland has an effect on deforestation rates.

* __(b)__ Run a regression of $Y$ (deforestation) on $Z$ (percentage change in pasture land) and interpret the results. Conduct a 
        hypothesis test that expansion of pastureland has an effect on deforestation rates.


<br>


__6.__ Use the data sets FIG51.XLS, FIG52.XLS, FIG53.XLS, and FIG54.XLS.

* __(a)__ Test whether $\beta = 0$ using the confidence interval approach for each of the four data sets.

* __(b)__ Test whether $\beta = 0$ using the $p$-value approach for each of the four data sets. Use a $5\%$ level of significance.

* __(c)__ Redo parts (a) and (b) for $\alpha$.

* __(d)__ Redo parts (a), (b), and (c) using a $1\%$ level of significance. 

* __(e)__ Comment on these results.


<br>


__7.__ Use the data set ADVERT.XLS. Set up and run a regression using this data and discuss your results as you would in a report
       to your manager. Include a discussion of the marginal effect of advertising on sales and a discussion of whether this marginal
       effect is statistically significant. 


<br>


__8.__ Use the data sets FIG51.XLS, FIG52.XLS, FIG53.XLS, and FIG54.XLS. Test whether $R^{2} = 0$ for each of the four data sets. 
       Compare these results with those found in exercise (6) above.
