__1.__ Using the HPRICE.XLS data set do the following.


* __(a)__ create $XY$-plots using the four explanatory variables in the house pricing example one at a time
  (i.e. plot $Y$ and $X_{1}$, the plot $Y$ and $X_{2}$ and so on).
  
* __(b)__ Perform simple regressions using the explanatory variables one at a time (i.e. regress $Y$ on $X_{1}$,
  then regress $Y$ on $X_{2}$ and so on).
  
* __(c)__ Comment on the relationships you find in parts (a) and (b).


__2.__ Using the HPRICE.XLS, let house price be the dependent variable ($Y$) and consider the following potential explanatory variables:

* $X_{1} =$ the lot size of the property (in square feet)

* $X_{2} =$ the number of bedrooms

* $X_{3} =$ the number of bathrooms

* $X_{4} =$ the number of storeys (excluding the basement).


* __(a)__ Regress $Y$ on $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$, and $X_{4}$ (i.e. recreate Table 6.1) and discuss your results. 

* __(b)__ Regress $Y$ on various subsets of $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, \mbox{ and}, X_{4}$ and discuss your results.

* __(c)__ Comparing your results for parts (a) and (b), examine the effect of omitting explanatory variables.


__3.__ Use the data set FOREST.XLS with deforestation ($Y$), population density ($X_{1}$), percent change in cropland ($X_{2}$) and percent change in pasture lang ($X_{3}$). Carry out multiple regression analysis of this data set addressing the issues raised in the chapter (Koop Chapter 6). For instance you may want to:

* __(a)__ Regress $Y$ on $X_{1}, X_{2}$, and $X_{3}$ and verbally interpret the coefficient estimates your obtain.

* __(b)__ Discuss the statistical significance of the coefficients. Are there explanatory variables that can be dropped?

* __(c)__ Discuss the fit of the regression.

* __(d)__ Calculate a correlation matrix. Through consideration of it and the regression results, discuss the issue of multicolinearity.
